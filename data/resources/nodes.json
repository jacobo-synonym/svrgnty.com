  "description": "The Bitcoin network is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network made up of thousands of nodes. Each node keeps a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and verifies every single transaction and block. By running a full node you can verify the state of the ledger yourself, rather than trusting a third party. Running a full node also makes the network more robust, making it more decentralized and resistant to certain types of attacks. Support the Bitcoin network by running your own full node.",
