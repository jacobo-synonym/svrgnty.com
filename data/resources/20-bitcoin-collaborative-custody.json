  "body": "<p>Collaborative custody is a multi-signature wallet arrangement where you retain control of the majority of the keys, while a third party, e.g. a custodial service, usually manages one of the keys. This setup offers peace of mind, knowing a key is secure, but it entails trade-offs.</p><ul class='list'><li><strong>KYC</strong>: One such compromise is the requirement for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, which involves disclosing your identity to the third party.</li><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Another trade-off is the visibility into your wallet given to the third party. Though they cannot access your funds, they can see the transactions and balance of the wallet.</li></ul>",
